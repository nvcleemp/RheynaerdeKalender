Rheynaerde Kalender
===================

A script to generate a year calendar for our fencing club (comments are mostly in Dutch)

This script is written in Python. It is far from an example of good style, but for now, it gets the job done. 
When I have some more time, I'll be updating it.

The script reads a list special days from a file called input.txt. The start and the end of the year are hard coded.
The days we have training are also hard coded. (As I said, this is not an example of good style.)

Why didn't I use XML? I wanted the input.txt file to be editable by people who just know how to turn on a computer.
